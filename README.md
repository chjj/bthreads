# bthreads

`worker_threads` wrapper for node.js. Provides transparent backends for
pre-v12.0.0 node.js (via `child_process`) as well as browser web workers.

## Usage

``` js
const threads = require('bthreads');

if (threads.isMainThread) {
  const worker = new threads.Worker(__filename, {
    workerData: 'foo'
  });

  worker.on('message', console.log);
  worker.on('error', console.error);

  worker.on('exit', (code) => {
    if (code !== 0)
      console.error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}.`);
  });
} else {
  threads.parentPort.postMessage(threads.workerData + 'bar');
}
```

Output:

``` bash
$ node --experimental-worker threads.js
foobar
$ node threads.js
foobar
```
